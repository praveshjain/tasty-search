#My experiments with elastic search

#Usage
  - Use Settings.py and Constants.py to configure the system
  - Use Scripts/index.py to index the data into elastic search. The location of data file can be changed from Constants.py
  - Search.py provides an interface to all operations for elastic search
  - The web module provides a simple REST interface to query the data
